        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, this is Selena sasabe and I'll be telling you a little about myself. I was born and raised in Riverside county so I got used to the norms, values, and status very quickly. In middle school and highschool I volunteered at churches and community centers. This helped me develop socialization with different people from different backgrounds/ ethnicities. I also played sports and competed against others schools, thus also having an impact on my life about the way I see people. I recently graduated highschool in 2021 from Banning High and have had two jobs since then. My first job was retail at a high end store. This involved a lot of socializing and connections and it took me out of my comfort zone. It opened my eyes to what my future could be like when socializing with others. It was not a bad experience, because I like talking to people but the manager forced us to follow them around and practically forced them to buy something. I quit because I didn't like that and found my current job. I work at a fast food place called Little Caesars. I know it's a step down from what I used to have but they treat their employees way better then they did at my old jobs. Even though it is a pain when customers yell over a five dollar pizza, at least I didn't force them to purchase it. This job has taught me a lot of things involving people. People are unpredictable and you should be prepared for anything, you don't know how their day has been and why they are doing what they do. A customer could be yelling at you to release some past anger from that day, they could be super nice to you because it's a special day for them. When working, I found out that I wanted to learn why people did those things, why they behaved the way they did. I wanted to better connect with them and their aspects. I took a sociology class last quarter and even though the teacher was not good at teaching, the book we read helped me understand why I wanted to pursue this career. I want to be able to relate to people, I want to understand them and maybe act like them too. I feel like I'm just too blunt because of my past so I don't really understand social cues or how to act when people are around. I can not handle big crowds, loud talking or loud machines, or sometimes even strangers. I have to get to know the person that I want to talk to in order for me to be comfortable. Besides helping people out in sociology, I also wanted to help myself. I want to understand why I can't do some of the things others can and how I can have alternatives to help me be more comfortable and less awkward. Learning about myself can help me learn about others too, not only positively affecting me but also other people
